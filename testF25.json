The warranty goes to 100,000 miles and added 7 years from the date of warranty purchase. The price was $2,247. The deductble is $100 and zero at AAA repair places, and is exclusionary (ie covers everything except a list of not-covered items like cosmetic problems, maintenance, rust, vert tops, earthquakes).<br>\n<br>\nI've had non-dealer 100k mile extended warranties on other cars- Audi, Land Rover, Saab, and each has paid out much more than twice my costs. (Yes - those cars are expensive to fix, eg, I paid $800 for the Audi A4 warranty and the warranty paid out about $8000 over 6 years, including the dealer charging $1500 to fix an AC vent actuator that needed the dash pulled out, and also $1k+ for the infamous control arms wear and creaking.)   And yes for some repairs the warranty company has a contractor visit the shop to be sure the repair is needed but that's only for $1k+ and the approval is quick.<br>\n<br>\nI've found that expensive repairs occur after the factory warranty expires and up to 100k miles.

My spare is a 135/10-18, 26.5\" tread diameter.  The car's   are 245/50-19, 28.6\" tread diameter.    \n\nThe new xDrive software  detects that a spare is on and moves the power to the other axle and turns off the traction control, preventing damage to the clutches in the transfer case and brakes.  The owner's manual says only that there will be weird handling characteristics when the spare is installed.  It doesn't limit the distance you can drive with the spare installed.\n\nThe hub and bolt hole pattern might be different between the F25 and the G01.   sells a spare & jack kit for he F25 with a 27.1\" tread diameter.   It's a \"jury rig,\" requiring a centering ring to match the rim's hole to the car's hub.  It's a good idea to buy spare centering rings.  They get bent (aluminum) or torn up (plastic).\n\n\n\nOur X3 is our family road trip car.  So, not having a spare was a deal breaker.   Othewise, we could  end up like these guys:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI carry an aftermarket spare in my F10 535i.  It hogs up trunk space.

My spare is a 135/10-18, 26.5\" tread diameter.  The car's  <a href=\"http://www.tirerack.com/a.jsp?a=AB2&amp;url=index.jsp\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"gal\">tires</a> are 245/50-19, 28.6\" tread diameter.    <br>\n<br>\nThe new xDrive software <b>supposedly</b> detects that a spare is on and moves the power to the other axle and turns off the traction control, preventing damage to the clutches in the transfer case and brakes.  The owner's manual says only that there will be weird handling characteristics when the spare is installed.  It doesn't limit the distance you can drive with the spare installed.<br>\n<br>\nThe hub and bolt hole pattern might be different between the F25 and the G01.  <a class=\"vglnk\" href=\"http://Bimmerzone.com\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span>Bimmerzone</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a> sells a spare &amp; jack kit for he F25 with a 27.1\" tread diameter.   It's a \"jury rig,\" requiring a centering ring to match the rim's hole to the car's hub.  It's a good idea to buy spare centering rings.
